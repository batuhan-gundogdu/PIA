# Project Name

Physics-Informed Autoencoders for Tissue Microstucturing of Prostate MRI

## Description

This project introduces a novel self-supervised deep learning model, Physics-Informed Autoencoders (PIA), which integrates a three-compartment diffusion-relaxation model with hybrid multi-dimensional MRI. PIA was trained to encode the biophysical model into a deep neural network to predict tissue-specific biomarkers without extensive training data requirements.

## Installation
To get started with this project clone the repository, fork it, create a new environment and install the necessary dependencies:

    git clone https://github.com/username/PIA.git
    cd PIA
    python -m venv .venv
    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Tutorial

(This will come for a more-generic model, until then please follow the tutorial.ipynb file for the 3-compartment diffusion-relaxation model I present here)
